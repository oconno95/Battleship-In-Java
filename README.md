# Battleship Clone

Group Member Names: Ryan O'Connor, David Holleman

## Introduction
For this project, we will create a Java Swing application that allows the user to play one or more games of
Battleship with a computer opponent. 

## Objectives:
* The user will be given a main menu where they can choose to start a game or quit the application.
* At any point in the game, the user can choose to go back to the main menu.
* The user will be able to use the mouse to move and rotate images of battleships onto their board.
* The computer will randomly determine where its ships will go.
* When the game starts, there will be 2 grids visible: a grid with the user's ships on it and 
    a grid representing the enemy's grid. The ships of the enemy will not be visible, but the user's
    ships will be visible on their grid.
* The computer or user will randomly be chosen to start first.
* On the user's turn, the user will click on a board representing the enemy's space.
  * If they hit the enemy's ship, the grid square will be marked red.
  * If they miss the enemy's ship, the grid square will be marked white.
* After the user's turn, the computer will choose a spot to attack on the user's board.
  * If the computer hits the user's ship, the grid square on the user's board will be marked red.
  * If the computer misses the user's ship, the grid square on the user's board will be marked white.
* This will repeat until one of the opponents loses all of their ships.
* The user will then be prompted to play again or go back to the menu.

## Additional Objectives:
If time permits, we may add the following features to the game:
* We can allow the user to save the progress of their game into a file and allow the user to import a game file to pick up where they left off.
* We could add a difficulty level to increase or decrease the intelligence of the computer opponent.
